# LoveCalculatorApp
## This is an basic web app made on popular love percentage calculating algorithm.
##### The algorithm is simple on paper. [Here is a video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFsLVG7EAZ4).
##### This is how algorithm works
        - Concatenates both names (string) with the word *loves* in between.
        - Then that string is converted into array of charachters.
        - Then we check and save the occurence of current element in array using loop.
           - After that we use filter method to remove the current element in loop.
           - Another loop is used to calculate the array in which occurence of elements are saved.
        - Final step is to display the result.
